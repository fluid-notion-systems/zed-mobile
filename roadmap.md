# Zed Mobile Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap tracks the implementation progress of Zed Mobile, focusing on agent functionality through collab server integration. The project creates a mobile companion app for Zed's agent panel.

## Development Guidelines

- We will be using hot reload to push to device and also run on desktop
- Make code changes to get a feature working. ONE FEATURE AT A TIME. No oneshotting.
- When a feature works as expected, update the roadmap.md file to check off the task, then git commit and push.
