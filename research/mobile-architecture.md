- Less optimal for heavy computational tasks
- Learning curve for Dart language

**Best For:**
- Rapid prototyping and MVP development
- UI-heavy applications with moderate complexity
- Teams with limited native mobile expertise
- Consistent cross-platform experience

### Option 2: Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)

**Technology Stack:**
- Shared Logic: Kotlin Multiplatform
- iOS UI: SwiftUI
- Android UI: Jetpack Compose

- Full access to platform-specific APIs
- Smaller app size than Flutter
- Leverages existing Android development knowledge
- Type-safe networking and serialization

**Cons:**
- Requires knowledge of both iOS and Android development
- More complex project setup and maintenance
- Longer development time for UI features
- Less mature tooling compared to Flutter
- Need separate UI implementations for each platform

**Best For:**
- Performance-critical applications
- Teams with strong native mobile expertise
- Apps requiring deep platform integration
- Long-term maintenance and evolution

### Option 3: React Native

**Technology Stack:**
- Framework: React Native (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Navigation: React Navigation
- State Management: Redux / Zustand
- Networking: fetch / axios
- Storage: AsyncStorage / WatermelonDB

**Pros:**
- Leverages existing web development skills
- Good performance for most use cases
- Large ecosystem and community
- Hot reloading for development
- Code sharing with web applications
- Strong debugging tools

**Cons:**
- JavaScript bridge performance overhead
- Frequent breaking changes in ecosystem
- Complex native module integration
- Memory usage can be higher
- Platform differences can be challenging

**Best For:**
- Teams with strong JavaScript/React expertise
- Rapid development with web code sharing
- Moderate performance requirements

### Option 4: Progressive Web App (PWA)

**Technology Stack:**
- Framework: React / Vue / Svelte
- Bundler: Vite / Webpack
- PWA Tools: Workbox
- State Management: Redux / Vuex / Svelte stores
- UI Framework: Tailwind CSS / Material-UI

**Pros:**
- Single codebase for all platforms
- Leverages web development skills
- Easy deployment and updates
- No app store approval process
- Responsive design principles
- Works on desktop as well

**Cons:**
- Limited access to native APIs
- Performance limitations for complex interactions
- iOS PWA support has limitations
- Cannot access all device sensors
- Network dependency for some features

**Best For:**
- Simple applications with basic mobile features
- Web-first development approach
- Quick prototyping and testing

## Recommendation Matrix

| Criteria | Flutter | KMM | React Native | PWA |
|----------|---------|-----|--------------|-----|
| Development Speed | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Performance | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| Platform Integration | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| Maintainability | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Team Learning Curve | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| App Store Approval | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

## Specific Considerations for Zed Mobile

### Real-time Communication Requirements
- WebSocket support for live Zed connection
- Low-latency message handling
- Background processing capabilities

**Winner: Flutter/KMM** - Both handle real-time communication well with proper background processing support.

### Voice Input Integration
- Platform-specific speech recognition APIs
- Audio recording and processing
- Wake word detection

**Winner: KMM** - Best access to native speech APIs, though Flutter has good plugin support.

### UI Complexity
- Message bubbles with syntax highlighting
- Code diff visualization
- Rich text rendering
- Custom animations

**Winner: Flutter** - Excellent custom UI capabilities with built-in animation framework.

### Development Timeline
- MVP delivery speed
- Iteration velocity
- Team expertise utilization

**Winner: Flutter** - Fastest path to MVP with single codebase and hot reload.

## Final Recommendation

**For Zed Mobile, we recommend Flutter** based on:

1. **Rapid MVP Development**: Single codebase allows faster initial delivery
2. **UI Flexibility**: Excellent support for custom chat interfaces and code rendering
3. **Community Ecosystem**: Rich package ecosystem for networking, state management, and platform integration
4. **Development Experience**: Hot reload enables rapid UI iteration
5. **Team Scalability**: Easier to onboard developers compared to native development

### Migration Path
If performance or platform integration becomes a bottleneck, Flutter allows for:
- Platform channels for native functionality
- Gradual migration to native screens for performance-critical features
- Future consideration of KMM for shared business logic while keeping Flutter UI

### Architecture Decision Record
- **Decision**: Use Flutter for Zed Mobile development
- **Status**: Proposed
- **Context**: Need for rapid MVP development with cross-platform support
- **Consequences**: Single codebase maintenance, potential future migration considerations for performance-critical features
